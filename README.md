Spittalpond <sup>Alpha</sup>
============================

<small>The closest Bermuda's got to an Oasis!</small>

What is it?
-----------

Spittalpond is an Python interface for the Oasis Django API webservices.
It acts as a front-end that allows you to run models, exposures and other
useful webservices in Oasis.
Effectively, it's turns you Oasis style .csv files into useful GUL data!

Requirements
-----------

Core Spittalpond depends on the Python [Requests] package. You can quickly
`pip` install this as necessary.

Also, of course, you will need to have [IPython] installed (as well as the
notebooks part of it) in order to view the IPython notebook examples.
