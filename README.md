Spittalpond
===========
<!-- The closest Bermuda's got to an Oasis! -->

What is it?
-----------

Spittalpond is an Python interface for the Oasis Django API webservices.
It acts as a front-end that allows you to run models, exposures and other
useful webservices in Oasis.
Effectively, it's turns you Oasis style .csv files into useful GUL data!

Installation
------------

You can quickly install this package by downloading the code and running the
following commands:

``` sh
$ cd path/to/spittalpond
$ python setup.py install
```

Dependencies
------------

Core Spittalpond depends on the Python [Requests] package. You can quickly
`pip` install this as necessary (if it is not automatically resolved with the
main setup command).

Also, of course, you will need to have [IPython] installed (as well as the
notebooks part of it) in order to view the IPython notebook examples.
