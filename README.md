Spittalpond
===========
<!-- The closest Bermuda's got to an Oasis! -->

What is it?
-----------

Spittalpond is an Python interface for the Oasis Django API webservices.
It acts as a front-end that allows you to run models, exposures and other
useful webservices in Oasis.
Effectively, it's turns you Oasis style .csv files into useful GUL data!

Installation
------------

You can quickly install this package by downloading the code and running the
following commands:

``` sh
$ cd path/to/spittalpond
$ python setup.py install
```

Usage
-----

Spittalpond can be quickly run by using the config interface. Note that you will
have modify the example.toml (of create your own) TOML configuration file to
point to your specific Oasis .csv files and you Oasis server. Then simply use
that config file as seen here:

```sh
$ cd path/to/spittalpond/
$ python ./spittalpond/config_interface.py ../examples/example.toml
```

Documentation on the config interface can be found [here].

Dependencies
------------

Core Spittalpond depends on the Python [Requests], and [pytoml] packages.
`pip install` this as necessary (if these dependencies are not automatically
resolved with the main setup command).

Also, of course, you will need to have [IPython] installed (as well as the
notebooks part of it) if you intend to view and run the IPython notebook
examples.

Potential Patches
-----------------

As of Oasis version R1.3, the Oasis Django server will need to be patched so
that Spittalpond will run correctly. Patches will be placed in the
`spittalpond/data` directory. You must apply all of the patches as so:

1. Move the patches onto the Oasis Django server into the `/var/www/django/`
   directory. (i.e use WinSCP to do this.)
2. Apply the patches one by one with the standard Unix [patch] command on
   the Oasis Django server:

   ```sh
   $ cd /var/www/django
   $ patch -p1 < file_upload.patch
   (Stripping trailing CRs from patch.)
   patching file oasis/app/views.py
   Hunk #1 succeeded at 8069 (offset -1274 lines).
   ```

   As you can see above, the output succeeded for hunk #3. If it happens
   to fail, you are probably not patching the correct server version.

   Note that `file_upload.patch` should be replaced with whatever patch
   you need to apply.
3. You will also need to restart the Apache server on the Oasis Django
   server: Run the following command:

   ```sh
   $ service apache2 restart
   ```

You should now be able to successfully run Spittalpond!
